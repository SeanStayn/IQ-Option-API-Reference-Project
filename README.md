# IQOption-API-Reference-Collection
This repository will contain an independent reference collection of the IQ-Option API.  

With this collection it is possible to create your own IQOption-API in every language you want. An additional goal is to hold this reference collection up-to-date. If IQOption change their API, you can get the API changes from this Reference-Collection.

Open an ISSUE if you think the API has changed!
